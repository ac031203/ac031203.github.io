Hey there! I'm Akshat Chaudhary.  

I'm a final year undergraduate at **[IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in)**, pursuing a **[B.Tech + M.Tech in Mathematics and Computing](https://maths.iitd.ac.in/Undergraduate)**. My interests span **Mathematics, Theoretical CS, and Finance**, with a growing passion for **NLP and Machine Learning**. Basically, if it involves numbers, algorithms, or markets—I’m all in!  

When I’m not deep into equations or code, you’ll probably find me on the **basketball court or smashing a table tennis rally**. Lately, I’ve been strumming my way through the **guitar** (read: annoying my neighbors), and I also have a thing for **stand-up comedy**—because life’s just a series of well-timed punchlines, right?
