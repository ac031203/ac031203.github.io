Welcome to my first ever blog!

This blog is gonna be something special and very close to my heart, it's about internships!

I will divide this into two parts: firstly, my personal experience, and second, some suggestions and tips for juniors.

### Context 

For those who are not familiar with the internship process in our college (which is similar in many colleges): a variety of companies visit our campus, be it tech, consult, finance, etc. Each company has its own recruitment procedures, but I will focus mostly on tech/finance-based companies. These firms typically have 2-3 stages of screening: resume shortlisting, online coding assessments (OA), and interviews. Some companies may also conduct a Group Discussion (GD) round, but this is uncommon for tech-based firms. 

For coding, one has to be familiar with basic-to-advanced Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). The OA generally consists of 3-4 problems to be solved in around an hour (varies from company to company). Many students practice from platforms like Leetcode (LC) and CodeForces (CF).

A side note: Finance-based firms, especially High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms, are a different breed altogether. These companies develop trading strategies and trade in financial markets using advanced math and programming, often executing trades in microseconds. They are referred to as "Quant firms" and are among the highest-paying companies globally. Broadly, these firms have two roles: Quant Researcher (QR) and Quant Developer (QD). QR roles focus on mathematical modeling and strategy design, while QD roles focus on developing high-performance trading infrastructure. To crack a QR role, one needs a strong grasp of probability and mathematics.

Being passionate about mathematics since childhood, I was naturally drawn to the QR role (not to mention the high pay, jk). I targeted top international HFT firms like Optiver and Da Vinci, especially because of their Amsterdam-based offices (a little travel dream, xD).

### Preparation Phase

In the summer of '24, I wasn't doing any internship or project and had just started preparing for the OA rounds. I rigorously practiced coding, solving problems for hours each day on CF & LC, often managing only 3-4 problems daily. This intense routine reminded me of my JEE preparation daysâ€”endless hours on the same chair and desk, isolated from my family, solely focused on coding.

Initially, my momentum was strong, but I soon hit a plateau, particularly struggling with advanced concepts like Graphs and DP. Around this time, I came across a free "3-day Graph Camp" conducted by a CF "Master" (referred to as MKV Sir) via IITD notices. Attending the camp turned out to be a game-changerâ€”it made complex topics feel effortless. Impressed, I enrolled in the full 2-month paid course that covered all relevant DSA topics for OA rounds.

Simultaneously, I prepared for QR roles by solving quant puzzles and studying probability intensively. Despite my efforts, my CF rating stagnated, which was frustrating. A long discussion with MKV Sir made me realize that rating wasnâ€™t my ultimate goalâ€”cracking OA rounds was. This shift in mindset helped me focus better. Around this time, I partnered with a friend to practice quant puzzles and coding problems daily.

For the QR roles, I specifically trained for the "80 in 8" test format used by some HFTsâ€”solving 80 arithmetic questions in 8 minutes! This intense preparation continued from May until early July.

### The Process & Shortlists

As mid-July approached, so did my anxiety. OA rounds started around the 16th, with most tests happening after the 23rd (when the semester began). To avoid distractions, I decided to travel back to campus early, on the 13th.

My initial OAs, including those for Google and Microsoft, went decently. The first QR tests (Ebullient, Millennium, etc.) also went well. However, the period leading up to Day 1 was relentlessâ€”back-to-back tests, sometimes three in a single day. The toughest day was when both my dream companies, Optiver and Da Vinci, had their OAs scheduled back-to-back. Exhausted, I underperformed and failed to qualify for either. The rejection was disheartening, but a friendâ€™s advice to focus on other companies helped me move forward.

Over the next few days, I faced more disappointments. Despite performing exceptionally well in Citadel Securities and another top Indian quant firmâ€™s tests, I wasnâ€™t shortlisted. By early August, just days before Day 1, I had zero shortlists and was feeling defeated. But as they say, "Sabar ka fal meetha hota hai"â€”patience pays off. Within a few days, I received over 10 shortlists, including Google, which was a huge morale booster.

For Day 1, I had six shortlists, along with their interview times (Relevant for next part):
- Google (11 AM)
- Eightfold.AI (Afternoon)
- American Express (Afternoon)
- Goldman Sachs (8 AM)
- Ebullient Securities (Afternoon)
- NK Securities (Afternoon)

### The Big Day & Aftermath

On August 3rd, the big day arrived. I wore formals for the first time, feeling both nervous and confident. My first interview (Goldman Sachs) started poorlyâ€”I struggled with an easy coding problem and blanked out. As expected, I wasnâ€™t called for the next round.

The Google interview was next. It went smoothly, and I was shortlisted for Round 2, which also went well. Unlike other companies, Google didnâ€™t have a third round, and results would be posted directly on the portal. I moved on to my next interview (Eightfold.AI), which also went well.

Later, while waiting, I checked my portal and found...

The excitement was surreal! I immediately called my family and shared the good news. But the day wasnâ€™t over yet. I got a call for my Ebullient Securities interview, a role I was even more passionate about.

Walking in confidently, I found my interviewer was an IITD alumnus. The questions were challenging, but I answered them well, particularly impressing him with my approach to a probability problem. The atmosphere became friendlier, and we even discussed regression concepts casually. After the interview, I received another callâ€”**I had cleared the first round!**

The second round focused on market-making concepts and behavioral questions. It was trickier, but I managed to perform well. After another anxious wait, I received the final call...

This was my dream job, my top preference! The feeling was indescribable. From having zero shortlists to securing my dream quant offer, the journey was nothing short of a rollercoaster.

### Takeaways & Tips for Juniors

1. **Focus on learning, not just ratings.** CF/LC ratings donâ€™t determine successâ€”your problem-solving ability does.
2. **Be strategic with your preparation.** Identify weak areas early and work on them (e.g., my Graph Camp experience).
3. **Donâ€™t get disheartened by rejections.** You only need one offer that aligns with your goals.
4. **Practice company-specific test formats.** If applying for QR roles, practice speed math rigorously.
5. **Have a support system.** Discuss problems with friends, seek mentorship, and stay positive.

This was my journeyâ€”hope it helps and inspires some of you. Until next time!
