# Welcome to my First Ever Blog!

This blog is something special and very close to my heart. As the title suggests, it's about internships!

I will divide this into two parts: firstly, my personal experience, and second, some suggestions and tips for juniors.

## Context

For those unfamiliar with the internship process in our college (which is similar in many other colleges), a variety of companies visit our campus, including tech, consulting, finance, and more. Each company has its own recruitment process. I will focus mainly on tech and finance-based companies.

These firms typically have two to three stages of screening:
1. **Resume Screening**
2. **Online Coding Assessments (OA)** - These usually require coding 3-4 problems in around an hour (varies from company to company). Most candidates prepare from platforms like Leetcode (LC), CodeForces (CF), etc.
3. **Interviews** - Some companies also conduct a Group Discussion (GD), though it's uncommon for tech roles.

### High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Firms

A special mention to finance-based firms known as **HFTs (High-Frequency Trading firms)**. These companies develop trading strategies to trade in financial markets using heavy mathematics and programming, often executing trades in microseconds! They are among the highest-paying firms in the world.

These firms generally have two types of roles:
- **Quant Researcher (QR)**: Focuses on developing trading strategies using math and statistics (math-intensive role).
- **Quant Developer (QD)**: Works on building trading infrastructure for executing fast trades (coding-intensive role).

For QR roles, math and probability questions are common. [A more detailed post on HFTs to be out soon!]

As someone who has loved Mathematics since childhood and majored in it, I was intrigued by the QR role (not to mention the high pay—just kidding!). Among the 5-10 HFT firms visiting our campus, I was particularly targeting international ones like Optiver and Da Vinci (Amsterdam was another motivation, xD).

### Some Key Dates
- **23rd July 2024** - New semester begins
- **3rd August 2024** - Day 1 of interviews

## My Personal Experience

### Summer '24 - The Preparation Phase

I wasn’t doing any internship or project that summer and had just started preparing for the OA rounds. I began grinding on CF & LC, solving problems for hours each day. It was a mentally exhausting yet fulfilling process, reminiscent of my JEE prep days—sitting at my desk for long hours, coding or doing random tasks.

Initially, my preparation had good momentum, but over time, I felt a lack of motivation, especially as my CF rating was not improving significantly. I realized I was struggling with advanced topics like Graphs and DP. Fortunately, I found a free **3-day Graph Camp** by a CF master (whom I’ll refer to as MKV Sir) on our IITD notices.

This camp was a game-changer! Graphs, which once seemed complex, became so intuitive. Encouraged by this experience, I enrolled in his **paid 2-month course** covering all DSA topics relevant to OA and interviews. Attending lectures and solving practice problems, I saw a lot of improvement.

Alongside this, I was also preparing for **quant puzzles and probability** for QR assessments. However, my obsession with CF rating continued, and I was getting frustrated at not achieving the **Specialist** rank despite doing well in course-organized contests. At this point, I had a **one-hour call with MKV Sir**, who advised me:

> *"Rating pe dhyaan mat do, Akshat."* [Don't focus on the rating.]

This struck me—I was chasing something unnecessary when my real goal was to crack the OA rounds. I then partnered with a friend, and we spent two hours daily solving quant puzzles and discussing coding problems.

I was particularly targeting two HFTs with a unique **“80 in 8”** test format—80 arithmetic questions in 8 minutes! So, I practiced extensively for this, demonstrating my deep desire for these roles. From May to early July, it was an all-day coding/math grind.

## The Process & Shortlists

Mid-July arrived, and so did my anxiety. The **OA rounds** were about to start!

The new semester began on **23rd July**, with tests scheduled from **16th/17th July** onwards. Until the 23rd, these could be taken remotely, but after that, all assessments and interviews were offline. Wanting to avoid disruptions, I **returned to campus early on 13th July**.

I took OA rounds for **Google, Microsoft, Ebullient, Millennium**, and other firms. Some went well, others not so much. The pace was **exhausting**, especially from **27th-28th July**, when I had **3-4 tests per day**.

### Major Setbacks

My **dream companies—Optiver and Da Vinci—had their tests on the same day**! On top of that, I had another test before them, making it **three tests in a single day**. I was drained by the time I reached Optiver’s test, messed up a section, and struggled in Da Vinci’s test as well. **I didn’t qualify for either.** 😞

Further disappointment followed when I didn’t make it through **Citadel Securities and another Indian quant firm**, despite finishing both their tests early.

With **Day 1 (3rd August)** approaching and **zero shortlists**, I was disheartened. **Was my two-month grind all for nothing?**

### The Turnaround: Shortlists Start Rolling In!

Finally, on **1st August**, I got **my first SL from Google!** 🎉 This was a major confidence booster. Soon after, more SLs came in, and I ended up with **10+ SLs, including 6 for Day 1!**

Day 1 SLs:
- **Tech:** Google, Eightfold.AI, Amex
- **Quant:** Goldman Sachs, Ebullient Securities, NK Securities

## The Day & Aftermath

### **The Big Day - 3rd August**

I woke up early, suited up for the first time ever, and headed to LHC for my **8 AM interview with Goldman Sachs**. Nervous but determined, I walked into the room.

Unfortunately, the interview didn’t go well. I **blanked out** on an easy coding question, struggled with a follow-up brain teaser, and realized my interview was significantly shorter than others. **I wasn’t called for the next round.** 😞

Not losing hope, I moved on to my **Google interview at 11 AM**. This went much smoother, and I cleared both rounds. I was told that the results would be posted later.

In the afternoon, I had my **Eightfold.AI** interview, followed by **Ebullient Securities**, one of my top choices. The Ebullient interviewer was an IITD alumnus, and the session focused on **probability problems and brainteasers**, which I **aced**.

### **The Big Reveal**

After my Google interview, I checked my portal, and there it was...

**💥 Google Offer Letter!**

I was ecstatic! I immediately called my parents and sister, who were super proud. 🎉 But I didn’t stop there—soon after, **I received a call from Ebullient for further rounds**. I walked in confidently, nailed the interview, and soon...

**🎯 I secured an offer from Ebullient Securities!**

It was a **dream come true!** After all the struggles, rejections, and intense preparation, everything finally fell into place.

## Conclusion

Internship season is tough—full of uncertainties, self-doubt, and long hours of preparation. But **resilience is key**. Even after setbacks, patience and perseverance can lead to great outcomes. To all my juniors:

**Stay focused, stay motivated, and trust the process!** 🚀
